A write occurs during the overlap of a low CS1, a high CS2, and a low WE. A write begins at the
latest transition among CS1 going low, CS2 going high, and WE going low. A write ends at the
earliest transition among CS1 going high, CS2 going low, and WE going high. tWP is measured
from the beginning of write to the end of write
